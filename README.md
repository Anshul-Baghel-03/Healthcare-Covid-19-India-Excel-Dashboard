# 🏥 Pandemic Patterns: Unveiling COVID-19 Dynamics in India Through Excel Dashboard Analytics

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the **spread, testing, and vaccination progress of COVID-19 in India** using multiple datasets and presents insights through an **interactive Excel dashboard**.

The goal is to leverage Excel’s **data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization capabilities** to uncover pandemic trends, assess the effectiveness of health measures, and provide policymakers and the public with **data-driven insights**.

---

## 🧾 Background
In late 2019, the world witnessed the emergence of **SARS-CoV-2**, leading to the global **COVID-19 pandemic**.  
India, with its vast and diverse population, faced immense challenges in tracking cases, testing, and vaccination.  

This deluge of data presents an opportunity to **understand the pandemic’s dynamics** at a granular level.

Through this case study, we aim to:
- Track **daily confirmed cases, recoveries, deaths, and testing patterns** across states.
- Examine the **progress of vaccination campaigns**.
- Develop an **interactive Excel dashboard** to simplify trend analysis and decision-making.

## 🎯 Objectives
1. Perform **end-to-end analysis** of COVID-19 data (cases, testing, vaccination).
2. Apply **Excel functions, formulas, and data cleaning techniques**.
3. Conduct **statistical and comparative analyses** (e.g., case fatality rate, pre vs. post-vaccination trends).
4. Build an **interactive dashboard** with slicers, timelines, and dynamic charts.
5. Provide **visual storytelling and actionable insights** for pandemic management.

## 📂 Datasets Used
1. **COVID-19 Cases** → `covid_19_india.csv`  
   - Daily reported confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths across states.  
   - Columns: Date, State/UT, Confirmed, Cured, Deaths, etc.

2. **Vaccination Data** → `covid_vaccine_statewise.csv`  
   - Dose-wise and demographic vaccination details.  
   - Columns: State, First Dose, Second Dose, Age-group data, Gender split, etc.

3. **Testing Data** → `StatewiseTestingDetails.csv`  
   - State-wise COVID-19 testing stats.  
   - Columns: Date, State, Total Samples, Positive, Negative.
